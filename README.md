# SoapAuthenticationExample

Welcome to the SoapAuthenticationExample repository!

## Overview

This repository contains an example solution demonstrating the implementation of SOAP and REST APIs, along with a shared library for common classes used across both projects.

### Projects

1. **SoapWebService**: This project showcases the implementation of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) API. It includes functionalities related to authentication and other operations.

2. **RestAPI**: Here, you'll find the implementation of a RESTful API. This project demonstrates a different approach to building APIs compared to SOAP, providing HTTP endpoints for various operations.

3. **CoreUtilitiesLibrary**: This shared library houses common classes and utilities utilized by both the SOAP and REST API projects. By centralizing common functionalities here, it promotes code reuse and maintainability across the solution.

## Features

- **SoapWebService**: 
  - Authentication: Implements authentication mechanisms using SOAP.
  - Operations: Provides functionalities for various operations using SOAP protocols.

- **REST API**:
  - HTTP Endpoints: Exposes endpoints for RESTful operations.
  - Data Handling: Demonstrates handling data via RESTful principles.

- **Core Utilities Library**:
  - Centralized Utilities: Houses common classes and utilities utilized across both SOAP and REST API projects.
  - Code Reusability: Encourages the reuse of code, reducing redundancy and promoting consistency.

## Usage

To explore the functionality of each project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rvallejosbarria/SoapAuthenticationExample.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice (SoapWebService, RestAPI, or CoreUtilitiesLib).
3. Execute the command `dotnet run` inside of each project folder to run it.
4. Follow the README instructions within each project directory for specific setup and usage guidelines.
